	<h1>About Marisela Meskus</h1>  
	<h2>Career Transition (2020 &#8211; 2022)</h2>
	I am pursuing a <b>Certificate in User Experience and Web Design</b> from the <abbr title="University of California, Santa Cruz">UCSC</abbr> Silicon Valley Extension (Winter 2021 &#8211; Winter 2022).
	<p>I first became interested in UX Design after getting the chance to create some webpages for the Cushing J. Library at Holy Names University. As the <b>Access Services Supervisor</b>, I was <em>only</em> responsible for updating the webpages assigned to me. But during the library building closure, I recognized a need. I suggested and designed new webpages that provided library service updates and community resources for students adjusting the learning online during the pandemic.</p>

	<h2>Supporting End-users (2017 &#8211; 2020)</h2>
	My work in libraries started in 2017 when I volunteered as a research assistant at the Oakland FamilySearch Library and at the California Genealogical Society library (also located in Oakland, CA) as part of the research team.
	<p>These experiences enabled me to get hired as a library assistant at the historic Mechanics' Institute in San Francisco. Within 6 months, I worked my way up from an on-call to a part-time position. In 2018, I earned the full-time position of <b>Serials & Public Services Library Assistant</b>. I managed both departments until 2020.</p>

	<h2>Family Genealogy Research</h2>
	I have been researching my family history since 2005, when my family took a trip to the Dominican Republic&#8211;my father's birthplace. I earned a <b>Certificate in Genealogical Research</b> from Boston University in 2017 and served on the board of the California Genealogical Society from 2018 to 2020.

	<h2>Education</h2>
	I received a <b>Master of Arts in <i>English (Linguistics)</i></b> from San Francisco State University in 2015 and a <b>Bachelor of Arts in <i>History</i></b> from <abbr title="University of California">UC</abbr> Merced in 2011. I am a 1<sup>st</sup> generation college graduate who was born in Merced and transferred from Merced College.
